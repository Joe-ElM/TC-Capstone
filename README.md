# 🏥 HealthBot - Multi-Agent AI Health System

An advanced multi-agent AI system for health education and symptom analysis, built with LangChain and Streamlit. This system uses 8 specialized AI agents with persistent memory to provide personalized health guidance.

## 🎯 What It Does

- **Intelligent Triage**: Classifies health queries and routes to appropriate agents
- **Symptom Analysis**: Researches symptoms using Wikipedia and web sources
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides diet, treatment, and lifestyle advice
- **Patient Memory**: Tracks conditions, medications, lab values across sessions
- **Safety Validation**: Multiple layers of medical accuracy checking
- **Smart Routing**: faster responses for follow-up questions

## ⚠️ What It Does NOT Do

- **Does not diagnose medical conditions**
- **Does not prescribe medications**
- **Does not replace professional medical care**
- **Not suitable for medical emergencies**
- **Educational purposes only**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Pipeline

1. **Profile Extractor**: Extracts patient information using structured LLM
2. **Triage Agent**: Classifies urgency and determines routing
3. **Diagnosis Agent**: Researches symptoms with external sources
4. **Diet Agent**: Calculates nutrition needs and dietary recommendations
5. **Treatment Agent**: Provides care guidance and scheduling
6. **Synthesis Agent**: Integrates all outputs into coherent response
7. **Coherence Checker**: Ensures continuity and personalization
8. **Hallucination Detector**: Validates medical accuracy and safety

## 📊 Workflow Diagrams

### Main Processing Flow

![Main Workflow](pics/main_workflow.png)

The primary workflow shows intelligent routing where the Triage Agent determines which specialized agents to activate based on query complexity and type.

## 🛤️ **The Routing Paths This Creates:**

| Triage Decision    | Actual Path                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"diagnosis_only"` | profile → triage → **diagnosis** → synthesis → validation                    |
| `"diet_only"`      | profile → triage → **diet** → synthesis → validation                         |
| `"treatment_only"` | profile → triage → **treatment** → synthesis → validation                    |
| `"full_pipeline"`  | profile → triage → **diagnosis → diet → treatment** → synthesis → validation |
| `"clarification"`  | profile → triage → **synthesis** → validation                                |

## 💡 **Why This Is Brilliant:**

**Without this logic**, every query would go through ALL agents:

```
triage → diagnosis → diet → treatment → synthesis  (slow!)
```

**With this logic**, the system is smart:

- Simple diet question: `triage → diet → synthesis` ⚡ (60% faster!)
- Quick symptom check: `triage → diagnosis → synthesis` ⚡
- Full consultation: `triage → diagnosis → diet → treatment → synthesis` 🔄

## 🔍 **Step-by-Step Example:**

**Scenario: User asks "What foods help with headaches?"**

1. **Triage Agent** analyzes → decides `routing_decision = "diet_only"`
2. **Conditional routing** from triage → sends to `diet_agent` (skips diagnosis)
3. **Diet Agent** runs → creates nutritional recommendations
4. **Diet Agent's conditional edge** checks:
   - `routing_decision in ["diet_only", "diagnosis_only"]` ✅ TRUE
   - Goes directly to `synthesis_agent` (skips treatment)
5. **Synthesis** → **Validation** → **Done!**

**Result:** 3 agents instead of 5 = much faster response!

## 🎯 **The Key Insight:**

The lambda functions **remember the original triage decision** and use it to determine whether each agent should:

- **Continue the pipeline** (for full consultations)
- **Jump to synthesis** (for focused questions)

This creates a **self-optimizing workflow** that automatically chooses the most efficient path based on the user's needs!

### Key Components

- **`MultiAgentHealthSystem`**: Main orchestrator class managing agent workflow
- **`PatientContext`**: Persistent patient data structure
- **`UserInput`**: Standardized input schema
- **Agent Results**: Structured outputs from each specialized agent

## 🔄 Schema & State Management

### Core Data Models

The system uses Pydantic models for type safety and structured data exchange:

#### Input Schema

```python
UserInput(
    symptoms: str,           # Primary user query
    age: Optional[int],      # Patient age
    gender: Optional[str],   # Patient gender
    medical_history: List[str],
    current_medications: List[str],
    allergies: List[str]
)
```

#### Patient Context (Persistent Memory)

```python
PatientContext(
    user_id: str,                    # Patient identifier
    age: Optional[int],              # Demographics
    gender: Optional[str],
    symptoms_timeline: Dict[str, List[str]],  # Date-indexed symptoms
    conditions: List[str],           # Known medical conditions
    lab_values: Dict[str, Dict],     # Test results with dates
    medications: List[str],          # Current medications
    lifestyle_factors: Dict[str, Any], # Height, smoking, exercise
    recommendations_given: Dict,     # Previous advice tracking
    last_updated: datetime
)
```

### Agent State Exchange

The system uses `MultiAgentHealthState` (TypedDict) for inter-agent communication:

```python
MultiAgentHealthState = {
    "user_input": UserInput,           # Original query
    "patient_context": PatientContext, # Persistent memory
    "triage_result": TriageResult,     # Routing decisions
    "diagnosis_result": DiagnosisResult, # Research findings
    "diet_result": DietResult,         # Nutrition recommendations
    "treatment_result": TreatmentResult, # Care guidance
    "synthesis_result": SynthesisResult, # Final integration
    "research_content": str,           # External API data
    "conversation_history": List[str]  # Session context
}
```

### Agent Output Schemas

Each agent produces structured outputs:

**TriageResult**: Classification and routing

- `urgency_level`: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/EMERGENCY
- `routing_decision`: Which agents to activate
- `confidence_score`: Certainty of classification

**DiagnosisResult**: Symptom analysis

- `symptoms`: Extracted symptom list
- `possible_conditions`: Research-based possibilities
- `severity_level`: Risk assessment
- `red_flags`: Warning indicators

**DietResult**: Nutritional guidance

- `nutritional_needs`: Calculated requirements
- `recommended_foods`: Beneficial options
- `dietary_restrictions`: Foods to avoid

**TreatmentResult**: Care planning

- `care_recommendations`: Actionable steps
- `follow_up_schedule`: Appointment guidance
- `when_to_see_doctor`: Urgency indicators

### State Flow Pattern

1. **Input Processing**: User query → structured UserInput
2. **Context Retrieval**: Load existing PatientContext
3. **Agent Pipeline**: Each agent reads previous results, adds output
4. **State Accumulation**: Outputs build in shared state dictionary
5. **Context Update**: PatientContext enriched with new information
6. **Response Generation**: Synthesis agent integrates all outputs

## 💻 Code Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from multi_agent_health_system import MultiAgentHealthSystem
from extended_schemas import UserInput

# Initialize system
health_system = MultiAgentHealthSystem()

# Process health query
user_input = UserInput(
    symptoms="I have a headache and feel tired",
    age=30,
    gender="female"
)

result = health_system.process_health_query(user_input, personality="friendly")
print(result["response"])
```

### Custom Agent Integration

```python
# Add progress tracking
def progress_callback(status, progress):
    print(f"{status} - {progress*100:.0f}%")

result = health_system.process_health_query(
    user_input,
    personality="concise",
    progress_callback=progress_callback
)
```

### Patient Context Access

```python
# Get patient summary
summary = health_system.get_patient_summary()
print(summary)

# Access specific patient data
context = health_system.patient_context
print(f"Conditions: {context.conditions}")
print(f"Lab values: {context.lab_values}")
```

## 🧪 Testing

Currently manual testing through Streamlit interface. Automated testing framework planned for future releases.

**Test manually:**

1. Start application: `streamlit run main.py`
2. Test different query types (symptoms, follow-ups, diet questions)
3. Verify agent routing in processing pipeline
4. Check patient context persistence

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **API Key Error**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in environment
- **Slow Responses**: Check internet connection for Wikipedia/Tavily searches
